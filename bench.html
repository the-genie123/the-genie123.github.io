					<h2>The Basics of the Bench Press</h2>
					<h3>How to perform a bench press</h3>
					<p>
						Bench press is performed with the back and glutes on the bench.
						The lifter holds the bar and unracks it. The lifter then begins to lower the bar to the chest.
						Once the bar is motionless on the chest, the lifter lifts the bar back up by extending the arms.
						Below is a video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ThePowerliftingToWin" target="_blank">PowerliftingToWin</a> who goes into a great detail on how to perform a bench press.

					<h3>Common causes for disqualification in competition</h3>
					<ul class="dis-list">
							<li>Failure to observe the referee's signals at the commencement or completion of the lift. </li>
							<li>Any change in the elected position that results in the buttocks breaking contact with the bench or lateral movement of the hands (between the referee's signals). </li>
							<li>Any excessive movement or change of contact of the feet during the lift proper.</li>
							<li>Allowing the bar to sink into the chest after receiving the referee's signal. </li>
							<li>Pronounced uneven extension of the arms during or at the completion of the lift. </li>
							<li>Any downward motion of the bar during the course of being pressed out. </li>
							<li>Contact with the bar by the spotters between the referee's signals. </li>
							<li>Any contact of the lifter's shoes with the bench or its supports. </li>
							<li>Deliberate contact between the bar and the bar rest uprights during the lift to assist the completion of the press. </li>
							<li>It is the responsibility of the lifter to inform any personally enlisted spotters to leave the platform as soon as the bar is secured at armâ€™s length. Such spotters shall not return to the platform upon completion or failure of the attempt. It is especially important for a spotter providing a centre lift off to leave the platform quickly so as not to impair the head referee's view. Failure of any personal spotters to leave the platform may cause disqualification of the lift. </li>
