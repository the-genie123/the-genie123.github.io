					<h2>A Brief Introduction to Powerlifting</h2>
					<p>
						Powerlifting is a recreational and competitive strength sport.
						<abbr title="Powerlifting">PL</abbr> started with odd lifts such as bicep curls and shoulder press.
						Modern <abbr title="Powerlifting">PL</abbr> consists of three main lifts, squat, bench press and deadlift.
						In competitive <abbr title="Powerlifting">PL</abbr>, the athlete is given three attempts to lift maximally on the three lifts.
						The best successful attempt of each lift is counted towards their total.
						Athletes are judged with other athletes with similar age, weight class and gender.
						Winner is selected based on their total and if 2 athletes had the same total, the lifter with lower bodyweight wins.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are many powerlifting federations around the world, however the most popular and recognized one is the IPF.
						IPF has created guidelines for how to perform the squat, bench press and deadlift.
						Each lift has to be done accordingly otherwise the lift is rejected and does not count towards the athlete’s total.
						There are 3 judges in an IPF competition. In order to have a “good”, 2 of the 3 judges need to approve the lift.
					</p>
					<p>
						In IPF, there are many weight and age classes.
						The classes were created so that athletes are competing with a similar age and weight category so that a heavier athlete is not compared to a lighter athlete and vice versa.
						Chosen athletes can represent their home country in the IPF world competition and compete against all the best athletes from different part of the world.
